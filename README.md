# MLOPS - Automating Hyper Parameter Tuning of CNN Model using DevOps Tools

*AIM of Project*

We have to create a Container Image using Docker that has Python3, Jupyter-Notebook, Keras, TensorFlow, OpenCV, Numpy and Pandas Library Installed using Dockerfile. We have to Automate this Container in such a way that as soon as we Launch this Container in REDHAT Linux OS, it should Automatically starts Training the Machine Learning Model, which we have Created on Convolutional Neural Network using a DataSet Created by us. This Model consists of set of Hyper Parameters which we have to tweak every time when ever model is trained until it gives an Accuracy over 80%. Now, using Jenkins Automation Tool in RHEL we have to create 5 jobs which will Complete the given real life problem Automatically.
